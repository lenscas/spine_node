# Spine_node

A wrapper around [rusty_spine](https://github.com/jabuwu/rusty_spine) to make it work with [monad_quad](https://github.com/lenscas/monad_quad/)

## Notice:

A good amount of the code regarding rendering comes from the miniquad example inside of rusty_spine.

Also, as this uses the official runtime you still need to agree to runtime license agreement from Spine if you want to use it.
